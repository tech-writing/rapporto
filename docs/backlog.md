# Backlog

## Iteration +1
- [x] Make it work.
- [x] Add "top changes" feature.
- [o] Reports: Consider more attributes for "top changes":
  body, created_at, closed_at, gravity (number of inbound links). 
- [o] Backend: Add API authentication, to be able to include contributions to private repositories.
- [o] Reports: Wide vs. compressed reports, e.g. using link labels like `[#]` (issues)
  and `[P]`, per enumerated repository, referencing activity within the
  corresponding time range.
